     Required by:
         root project 'AquaCoreBreak'
      > Dependency resolution is looking 
for a library compatible with JVM runtime 
version 17, but 'io.papermc.paper:paper-api:
1.21-R0.1-SNAPSHOT:20240810.100446-132' is 
only compatible with JVM runtime version 21 
or newer.

* Try:
> Change the dependency on 'io.papermc.paper
:paper-api:1.21-R0.1-SNAPSHOT:20240810.10044
6-132' to an earlier version that supports 
JVM runtime version 17.
